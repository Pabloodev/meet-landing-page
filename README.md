## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this challenge I can learn a lot about how to deal with the "background image" where I can change the image.


```css
footer {
    background: linear-gradient(rgba(77, 150, 168, 0.8), rgba(77, 150, 168, 0.8)), url('/assets/desktop/image-footer.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 5vw 15vw;
    height: 310px;
}
```

### Continued development


In continued study, I find myself obliged to continue practicing responsive CSS that actually works on any device, regardless of size!
